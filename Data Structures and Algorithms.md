# Data Structures and Algorithms

## why  data structures and algorithms is an important topic to know about?

it is because we need them to minimize the complexity "big O" so our code won't take long to finish executing and tech company ask you as a developer about it

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

adding and delete in addtion accessing the data for example link list is easier to add a value but it is hard to get to a the third element because it need to get to the second element before goint to the third and before getting to the second element i much get to the first element.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

to check if you base case is working because if you one of the condition isn't working it will go to became infinte loop
