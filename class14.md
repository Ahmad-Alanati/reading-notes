## reading Questions

1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.


matplotlib is has some strength here they are:

- i provides low-level control over individual elements of the plot

-  it supports a variety of plot types

Seaborn is has some strength here they are:

- it simplifiees the process of creating complex visualizations by providing default themes

- it focuses on statistical relationships and patterns in data.

Bokeh is has some strength here they are:

- it is a library specifically designed for interactive visualizations

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

function for creating Relational Plots:

- scatterplot: this function job is to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables.

- lineplot: this function job is to create a line chart to show the trend or relationship between two variables.

- relplot: this function job is to generates a flexible high-level interface for creating various relational plots.

function for creating Categorical Plots:

- barplot: this function job is to create a bar plot to display the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric variable.

- countplot: this function job is to displays the count of occurrences for each category in a categorical variable.

- boxplot: this function job is to create a box plot to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable across different categories.

- violinplot: this function job is to create a violin plot, which combines a box plot and a kernel density estimation, to show the distribution of a numeric variable across categories.

function for creating Distribution Plots:

- histplot: this function job is to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a single variable.

- kdeplot: this function job is to create a kernel density estimation plot to estimate the probability density function of a continuous variable.

- distplot: this function job is to create a histogram and a kernel density estimation plot to represent the distribution of a variable.

3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

just the Figure Aesthetics part where in the matplotlib you have a lot of plot but you can't control the aesthetics
