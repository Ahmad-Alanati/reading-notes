# Class 01 reading

## why this topic matters?

learning how to deal with stress is a topic every programer must know about because in any job you have to deal with deadlines, your working states and more.

## reading Questions 

1. In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

    to deal with problems you are facing in the moment with time restrictions.

        how to deal with this problems is up to you, you can manage you time so the time restriction won't take a toll on you.

        or you can improve you programing skill so you can find the solution easyer.

        or you can improve your researching skill so finding a solution for a problem you are facting with your code won't take much of your time.

2. After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

        Big O is a way to represent how long it takes to finish a specific process for example how long it takes to sort some data in an array you can sort them with frequency array and that will take O(N) to finish but with the restriction of the programe knowing the domain of numbers.

        or you can use Insertion Sort and that will take O(N^2) but without the restriction of you should know the number domain.

3. Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

mutable data is a datatype where when you refer to it by a name and you and change it it will change even if you create another reference to it by another name it will point to that data so changing it with one of the reference it will change the data.

immutable datatype is different from mutable because when you create a immutable datatype and refer to it by a two names and then change one of them it will create another value then making the one we change refer to it so the data we created it first still refered by the other name.
