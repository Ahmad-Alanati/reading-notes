3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.


Django views are essential components that manage incoming HTTP requests in web applications. When a user accesses a URL, Django directs the request to the appropriate view, which processes the data and generates an HTTP response. Views interact with models, perform data processing, and construct responses, acting as a crucial link between the frontend and backend of a Django app.

##### Function-Based Views (FBVs)

Function-Based Views (FBVs) are traditional Python functions used as views. They take an HTTP request as input and return an HTTP response. FBVs are simple and suitable for smaller projects or basic request handling.

##### Class-Based Views (CBVs)

Class-Based Views (CBVs) are Python classes used as views. They offer a more organized and reusable way to define views. CBVs handle different HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) with separate class methods, improving code structure and readability.
