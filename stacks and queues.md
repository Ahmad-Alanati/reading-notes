# stacks and queues

## what is a stack

stack is one of data structure and it is made out of nodes, each node are references to the next node and the only thing you can get from that stack is the last node you added to the stack.

Common terminologys for a stack are:
1. push: node are put into the stack are pushed and it push them to the end of it.
2. pop: removing a node from the stack and it removes it from the end.
3. top: this is the node in the top of the stack.
4. peek: when you peek you will see the top in other word you will see the top node in the stack.
5. isEmpty: check if the stack is empty and if it is it will return ture else false.

Stacks follow these concepts:

1. first in last out.
2. last in first out.

2. Dequeue: removing a node from the Queue and it removes the first node.
3. Front : this is the first node in Queue.
4. Rear : this is the last node in Queue.
5. Peek : when you peek you will see the Front in other word you will see the Front node in the Queue.
